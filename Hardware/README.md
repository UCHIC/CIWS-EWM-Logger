# Hardware Design Files

The files in this directory describe the hardware design of the dataloggers we are using for water meters with electronic sensor outputs used in our university's residential buildings. Design files include electrical schematics for the hardware added to the Raspberry Pi as well as pictures.<br>
## Multi-Sensor Configuration
The most recent hardware schematics are EWM-None-Schematic.pdf (for units without a Building Automation System) and EWM-BAS-Schematic.pdf (for units with a Building Automation System). These schematics are located under the directory multi-sensor.<br>
## Single-Sensor Configuration
Hardware designs for the single-sensor dataloggers are under the directory single-sensor.
